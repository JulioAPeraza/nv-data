# NeuroVault Public Data Archive

This repository contains archived data from NeuroVault.org.

The data has been dumped from a subset production database concerned with the "statsmaps" application, and censoring has been performed to remove user related information.

## Tables

Within the statsmaps subset, the following tables are included:

### Collections
* `statmaps_collection`
This is the main table that indexes NeuroVault Collections. Critically the `id` column is the primary key for the table, and is used to link to other tables (refered to in other tables as `collection_id`)
* `statmaps_collection_contributors`
Association of collections with `user_id`


### Collection Items / Images
* `statmaps_basecollectionitem`
This is the main table that indexes NeuroVault Collection Items. Critically the `id` column is the primary key for the table, and is used to link to other tables as `basecollectionitem_ptr_id`
* `statmaps_image`
Images are a type of Collection Item. This table contains the image specific information. The column `basecollectionitem_ptr_id` in this table corresponds to `statmaps_basecollectionitem.id`
* `statmaps_statisticmap`
StatisticMaps are a type of Images, with additional meta-data, such as `smoothness_fwhm`, `cognitive_paradigm_cogatlas_id`.
The column `image_ptr_id'` in this table corresponds to `statmaps_basecollectionitem.id` & `statmaps_image.basecollectionitem_ptr_id`
* `statmaps_atlas`
Atlases are a type of Images, with an additional reference to `label_description_file`. the column `image_ptr_id` refers to `statmaps_basecollectionitem.id` & `statmaps_image.basecollectionitem_ptr_id`.

### Cogntive Atlas
* `statmaps_cognitiveatlastask`
Mapping of `cog_atlas_id` (referenced in `statmaps_statisticmap`) to task names
* `statmaps_cognitiveatlascontrast`
Mapping of `cog_atlas_id` referenced in `statmaps_statisticmap`) to contrast names

### Other tables
* `statmaps_collection_communities`
Grouping of collections into "communities". 
* `statmaps_communities`
Listing of communities. This is specific to two communities, "Developmental Neuroscience" and "Nutritional Neuroscience"
